# Counter Share Analysis for FMCG companies

Modern retail chains(DMart, Big Bazaar etc.) store a variety of
products from different brands. Each brand competes to get better visibility in
the store so a consumer can buy them. The stores charge a premium to the
brands to place their products on shelf at eye level, or around the corner of the
aisle or on the billing counter. They also charge a premium to give majority space
to a particular brand by suppressing the other brandâ€™s visibility. It becomes
extremely difficult for the brands to validate if the stores are complying with the
contract terms by giving actual visibility.
We plan to built an intelligent counter share analyser that can analyse video,
images and derive the % of brand presence on a particular section.
